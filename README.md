# TripleTen-Projects
Projects I worked on while attending the BIA TripleTen Bootcamp:

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Purchase Activity | This project used Sheets to clean and analyze purchase data to determine the percentage of customers that moved on from each stage in the purchasing process and calculate retention rates. |
| 2 | Superstore Profits | The project used Tableau to determine key areas where the store was losing profit and gaining profit the most (categories, specific products, which states were the most profitable in which months, etc.) |
| 3 | Superstore Returns Analysis | For this project I analyzed the Superstore dataset to determine what categories had the most returns, which customers returned the most (state, customer names) and what days of the week had the most returns. |
| 4 | BPM Analysis | For this team project competition, I worked with my partner to determine patterns in what types of workouts resulted in lowest BPM results in gym member participants. The data was analyzed across participant gender, types of workouts, length of workout, etc. |
